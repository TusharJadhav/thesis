% Example SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis.
% Lines beginning with % are comments and are ignored.
% 
% The class file sdsu-thesis.cls must be in the current directory or
% installed with the other classes as per standard LaTeX installation.
% 
% To generate run these commands:
% latex  thesis
% bibtex thesis
% latex  thesis
% latex  thesis
% Then you need to use the dvips command to get postscript output
% 
% See the README file for more information
% 
\documentclass{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% For early printouts to save paper use the savepaper option as
% 
% \documentclass[savepaper]{sdsu-thesis}
% 

% This will make things single spaced, use small font and smaller
% margins.  Stuff will be formatted differently if you don't use this
% option but it's useful to basically see (read) what you typed so far
% on paper without wasting much paper.  You might want to also comment
% out the front matter and backmatter if printing out in savepaper
% mode to save paper there.  Do not use this option on your final
% printout as it doesn't satisfy the thesis manual requirements.

% Also if you want to use double spacing rather then singlespacing (if
% your thesis is very short, say 25 pages or less), then use the
% `doublespace' option as
% 
% \documentclass[doublespace]{sdsu-thesis}

% For including graphics use
% (Info) http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics
%
% NOTE: My *may* need the graphicx package to get the correct
% page-size (letter) for your document... Some environments,
% e.g. TeXnicCenter default to 'a4' page size.
%\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{graphicx}

% These packages may also be useful for pictures...
% \usepackage{color}
% \usepackage{eepic}
% \usepackage{epic}
% \usepackage{grapic}

% Since this is a math thesis, you quite likely want these:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsthm}

% This makes captions *bold*
\usepackage[bf,labelsep=period,textfont=bf,singlelinecheck=off,justification=raggedright]{caption}

\usepackage{threeparttable}

% Other useful packages for theses (see LaTeX docs for descriptions of these)
% 
% For the \vref commands that also prints out the reference page
% \usepackage{varioref}
% 
% For including computer code
% \usepackage{alltt}
% 
% For the \url{http://foo.com} command to include url's (or filenames)
% \usepackage{url}
% 
% For multi page tables
\usepackage{longtable}

% This package countains the \sout command (which you should never use!)
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

\newtheoremstyle{dtm}% name of the style to be used
  {0pt}% measure of space to leave above the theorem. E.g.: 3pt
  {0pt}% measure of space to leave below the theorem. E.g.: 3pt
  {\slshape}% name of font to use in the body of the theorem
  {0pt}% measure of space to indent
  {\bfseries}% name of head font
  {. }% punctuation between head and body
  {0pt}% space after theorem head
  {}% Manually specify head
\theoremstyle{dtm}

% The style of theorems and such that you want to use.  You can change
% the style by modifying the second argument (for example prepending a
% formatting command, e.g. \textsc{Theorem} which will make the
% headings come out as small caps rather then bold).
% 
% On second thought, don't change these formats as you are likely to
% incur the wrath of the Thesis Reviewer.

% Author name and the author name in upper case
% (FORMAT) Has to match university records, check if you have
% (FORMAT) full middle name, or middle initital on record.
\author{Tushar Sarjerao Jadhav}

% Title of the thesis (all in upper case), use \\ for line breaks as
% usual, you can use up to 4 lines and make sure to set the counter
% titlelines to the number of lines you used.
% 
% This is for the title page
% 
\title{AN ALTERNATIVE DATA STRUCTURE TO LINE SWEEP ALGORITHM}
% Number of lines in the title, without setting this the title page
% will not be formatted properly
\setcounter{titlelines}{2}

% Heading style title, the number of lines can be different here then
% in titlelines and in fact the thesis manual requires that this be at
% most 3 lines long so only put at most 2 pagebreaks here.  This is
% for the abstract pages and the signature page.
% 
% (FORMAT) Make sure that this title has the EXACT same words at the
% (FORMAT) title-page-title
% 
\titleheading{An Alternative Data Structure to Line Sweep Algorithm}

%
% (FORMAT) The "degree" is set on three lines; select one of the
% following formats.  See DTM P.41
%
% Degree (MA-Math)
%\degreeONE{Master of Arts}
%\degreeTWO{in}
%\degreeTHREE{Mathematics}

% Degree (MS-Math)

% Degree (dual, concurrent)
%\degreeONE{Master of Science in Applied Mathematics}
%\degreeTWO{and}

% If you need to change the word 'Thesis' use \thesisname{Blah} and if
% you need to change the middle line between \degree and \degreein on
% the titlepage to something other then 'in' use \inofand{of} to use
% 'of' for instance.  (This should not be necessary)

\begin{acknowledgments}
  First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Joseph Lewis, who has patiently supported me throughout my thesis with wisdom and knowledge whilst allowing me the room to work in my own way. I attribute the successful completion of my master’s program to his thoughtful guidance and words of encouragement. It would not have been possible to complete this thesis work without his valuable support. I would say I am fortunate enough that I found such a knowledgeable and cooperative supervisor.  Professor Lewis was always available either in person or via email whenever I needed his assistance and technical guidance.  I sincerely appreciate his dedication towards his students and I am proud to be one among them.
  
  I would also like to express my deep gratitude to Prof Alan Riggins and Prof Joseph M. Mahaffy for accepting to be a part of my thesis committee and believing that I could complete the thesis without knowing me much. I hope that I have met your expectations.

\end{acknowledgments}
